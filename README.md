This is a tool for educators (or anyone, really) to create simple interactive animations. Originally a group project made for Hack&Roll 2019, a hackathon organized by NUS Hackers.

You use the tool by creating elements (circles, polygons, images) and specifying their start and end states. E.g. Having a circle start with radius 5 on the left of the canvas, and end with radius 10 on the right side. Dragging the slider will then interpolate between the two states.
